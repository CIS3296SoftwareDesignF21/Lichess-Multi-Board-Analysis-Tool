## Project Description
The Lichess Multi-Board Analysis Tool is a chess analysis tool for players of the online chess platform Lichess. It enables users to search through the previous games of any Lichess player by opening and color and to display selected games on the page, side-by-side. The application allows for simultaneous control of all boards for convenient examination of the flow of similar games.   

For instance, say you were participating in a chess tournament and you knew your opponent's Lichess username. You'd be able to search for their most recent games, identify their opening choices, and search for only games they've played with that opening. You'd then be able to lay these games on the page, side-by-side, to analyse their decision making in specific situations.   

There are many ways this tool can be improved upon, but even in its current state, one can utilize it to explore any set of games from Lichess and begin making improvements to their own play.
