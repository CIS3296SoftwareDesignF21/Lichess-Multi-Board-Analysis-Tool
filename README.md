# Lichess-Multi-Board-Analysis-Tool

## Project Description

## Installation & Building

## Updated Proposal

## Product Vision

For chess players of all ages and skill levels who are interested in improving their chess skills through self-analysis, the Lichess Multi-Board Analysis Tool (LMBAT) is an extension of Lichessâ€™s analytical toolkit that enables users to analyze multiple past games simultaneously to improve their understanding of how a given position can play out. 

Unlike most other chess analysis tools, the LMBAT allows you to step through multiple games simultaneously, side-by-side, to easily visualize how decisions made in those games can impact the outcome.
